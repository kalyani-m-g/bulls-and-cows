Bulls and Cows Game
A simple browser-based Bulls and Cows game where you guess a 4-digit secret number with non-repeating digits from 1-9. You get 5 tries to guess correctly. After each guess, the game tells you how many bulls (correct digit and position) and cows (correct digit, wrong position) you have.

 What did you learn while making this app?
- How to generate a unique random 4-digit number without repeating digits.
- Implement input validation using regular expressions and Set.
- Basic game logic to count bulls and cows.
- Managing game state like number of attempts and disabling inputs.

 What feature did you enjoy building the most?
The core bulls and cows calculation was fun â€” especially making sure bulls and cows counts are accurate for all input cases. Also liked adding the try limit and cleanly ending the game with proper feedback.

 What would you add next if you had more time?
- A restart button to play again without refreshing the page.
- Better UX: highlight digits or add colors for bulls and cows.
- Track and display a leaderboard or number of wins/losses.
- Mobile-friendly enhancements and animations.
- More detailed input hints or error messages.
